# ServiceFabric-TicTacToe
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game based on Service Fabric actor-model backend.

This project starts from a sample found on the book "Programming Azure Service Fabric", and show how to build an actor-based application to manage a turn-based game like Tic-Tac-Toe.
In this solution I added a simple WPF application in order to play against cpu (without AI, only random moves) using ActorProxy
